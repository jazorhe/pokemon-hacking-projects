 1. Description
______________________________________________________________________


 Lunar IPS (LIPS) is intended as an easy to use, lightweight IPS patch
 utility for windows to replace the SNESTool DOS program.  It can both
 create and apply IPS patches.

 As far as features go, LIPS has:

 -IPS patch creation/application support.
 -full RLE encoding/decoding support.
 -file expanding/truncating support.
 -the IPS encoder creates files that are the same size or smaller
  than files created with SNESTool.
 -the IPS encoder avoids the rare "0x454F46 (EOF) offset bug" that
  SNESTool's IPS encoder has.
 -logging feature for applying IPS patches (ROMFileName.log).
 -registers the ".IPS" file type so that you can just double click on
  an IPS file and choose the file to apply it to for convenience.
 -support for patching files up to 16 MB in size, which is the limit
  of the IPS format.  The files can technically be larger than that,
  but the IPS format cannot record changes beyond the 16 MB mark due
  to 24-bit addressing.  The IPS file itself can be any size.

 Note that the logging and file registration options are saved to
 the registry.
